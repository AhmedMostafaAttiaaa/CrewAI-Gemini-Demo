# 🤖 Gemini + CrewAI Demo (No OpenAI Required)

This is a simple demo showing how to use **CrewAI** with **Gemini (Google's LLM)** instead of OpenAI.  
It builds a minimal multi-agent system that plans and writes an article collaboratively using API-based interaction with Gemini.

---

## 📌 Description

A minimal working demo for using **CrewAI** with Google's **Gemini** models, without relying on OpenAI.

This project includes:
- A basic **Content Planner + Content Writer** setup using CrewAI
- Google Gemini API integration (via `requests`)
- Task-based workflow to generate an article
- Output saved as Markdown and PDF
- Ready for download directly from notebook UI

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.

2. Set your Gemini API key in the notebook:

```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook `DemoCrewGemeni.ipynb` and run step-by-step.

4. You’ll get a structured article generated by the AI agents:
   - ✅ Displayed in the notebook
   - 📝 Saved as `.md` and `.pdf`
   - ⬇️ Downloadable from the UI

---

## 🧠 Agents

Two simple AI agents built with **CrewAI**:

- **🧩 Content Planner**  
  Plans the structure and ideas of the article.

- **✍️ Content Writer**  
  Expands the plan into a full article.

They communicate **sequentially** using a simple task-passing mechanism.

## 📄 Output Example

You will get:

- ✔️ Final full-length article  
- 📝 Markdown file (`article_output.md`)  
- 📘 PDF file (`article_output.pdf`)  
- 💡 Optional rich-colored terminal output

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install crewai fpdf
```

You’ll also need:
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab / VSCode
- A valid Google Gemini API key

---

## 🌐 Gemini API Used

```http
POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-pro:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

No need for `openai` or `litellm`. Just pure requests.

---

## ✅ Example Code Flow

```python
# 1. Send prompt to Gemini
response = gemini_generate("Plan an article about AI in Education")

# 2. Pass response from planner to writer
final_article = gemini_generate("Write a full article based on this outline:
" + response)

# 3. Save to Markdown and PDF
save_markdown("article_output.md", final_article)
save_pdf("article_output.pdf", final_article)
```
